# Contributing

For features please open a [discussion][] and we can make sure the feature fits with the gem before working on it.

## Steps

1. [Fork][] the repo.
2. Add a breaking test for your change.
3. Make the tests pass.
4. Push your fork.
5. Submit a pull request against the `next` branch.

## Code Style

Running the tests using `rake` (with no args) will also check for style issues in the code.
If you have a failure you cannot figure out push the PR and ask for help.
